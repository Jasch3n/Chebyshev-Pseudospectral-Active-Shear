# **Figure Descriptions**
These figures were all generated off Python code provided by Alex Morozov. 

## sigma-vs-k-1: 
- this plot seems to show a maximum of the real part of $\sigma$. As the value of $\tau_a$ increases (equivalently, as the value of $a$ decreases), the curves seem to get "squashed down". 
- In addition, all the curves experience a distinct kink where the eigenvalue suddenly starts to grow.

## sigma-vs-k-2:
- this plot is the same as `sigma-vs-k-1` but with a wider range of $k$, ranging $[0,10]$ as opposed to $[0,5]$.

> ## What is going on around the region that $k$ has a maximum? This seems to be key to the instability mechanism
