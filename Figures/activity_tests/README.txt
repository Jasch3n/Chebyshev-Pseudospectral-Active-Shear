The MATLAB figures in this folder were an attempt to locate the approximate location of the
critical activity (aBar) for k=3 and gammaDot=10. For this set of parameters, the critical aBar value
was determined by inspection to be between 1 and 1.1.

Note that length is measured in units of W. That means k=3 indicates wavelength = 0.6*pi = 1.88... Giving a 
perturbation wavelength almost 2 times the channel width. What happens if the perturbation wavelength is much smaller
than the channel width?
