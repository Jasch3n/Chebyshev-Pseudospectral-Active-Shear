The data was generated by a full nonlinear simulation using the FEniCS python package in the paper "Flow states of two dimensional active gels driven by external shear" by Wan Luo et al.

'inf_length_channel_evs' is created by Jasper's script running on an infinite-length channel with finite width.
Every other parameter was kept the same (at least is believed to), and a comparison was made between the stability 
diagrams of the two different systems using the data that Wan provided -- she used this data to make Figure 4
in her Flow States paper. 

The comparison figure was stored in the figures folder in the 2-dimension folder
