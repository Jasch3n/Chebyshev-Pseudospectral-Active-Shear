The solutions look roughly periodic on test1, with the exception of the 3rd eigenfunction, which I think
might be because of the singular matrix warning

When gammaDot is cranked up to 100, the eigenfunctions of Psi become more clustered together

When gammaDot is cranked up to 1000, the eigenvalues because NaN

Fixed equations using Wan's Mathematica notebooks
Implemented more plotting functions

(?) The eigenfunctions for Psi in zero_activity_test_1 do not vanish
at the left boundary. What is up with that? 

-------------------------- 7/18 -------------------------
Performed analysis based on the transition diagram in Wan's paper.

Confusingly, there is NO stable-unstable transitions at gammaDot*tau = 0.6 for different values of aBar. All
eigenvalues have negative real parts!

(?) What now distinguishes the effect have gammaDot and tau since we are collapsing them into one dimensionless
constant? Do they contribute to the same effects?
