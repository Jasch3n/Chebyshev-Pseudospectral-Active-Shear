The solutions look roughly periodic on test1, with the exception of the 3rd eigenfunction, which I think
might be because of the singular matrix warning

When gammaDot is cranked up to 100, the eigenfunctions of Psi become more clustered together

When gammaDot is cranked up to 1000, the eigenvalues because NaN
