Each file's name corresponds to an entry from an array of activities. The number following "a_" is the index of the
activity in that array.

Each file then has g rows, each corresponding to a shear value. 
g is the number of shear values used to compute the eigenvalues.

Each row has K values. K is the number of perturbation wavevector values between k_left and k_right, which is
defined in the code.

The data in this folder is generated by zooming in on the extensile region to compare with the plot from Wan's paper.
